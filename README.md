The following project helps predict the score of the student using past data of students with the score that they have achieved. 
The model uses a linear regression model to predict the outcome. 
Further more to make it user-friendly I have used Flask (a microweb framework) to connect the Python code to an HTML form. 
Once users enter the details, this HTML form sends the data to the app. py python code which runs the flask (micro web framework), which then uses a pickle file named mod.py generated by the machine learning model, which predicts the score using linear regression.
Interpreting all the data and services used for the prediction, we produce an output. This output is displayed on the Html website.
