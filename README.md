Then Following project helps predict the score of the student using past data of students with the score that they have achived. 
The model uses Linear Regression model to predict the outcome. 
Further more to make it user friendly I have used flask (micro web framework) to connect the python code to a HTML form.
Once user enter the details this HTML form sents the data to the app.py python code which runs the flask (micro web framework) which then uses a pickle file named mod.py generated by the machine learning model which predicts the score using Linear Regression.
Interpreting all the data and services used for the prediction we produce an output.
This output is displayed on the Html website.
